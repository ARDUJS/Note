From a reading of the somewhat scant English-language medical literature on RU-486, the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around	This is not only because it kills the unborn, a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient, zapping only 50% to 85% of them depending on which study you read (prostaglandin, taken in conjunction with the pill, boosts the rate to 95%).
By contrast, surgical abortion is 99% effective. 

Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.
It is time-consuming (the abortion part alone lasts three days, and the clinical part comprises a week's worth of visits), bloody (one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion, although for most it resembles a menstrual period, with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days), and painful (many women require analgesic shots to ease them through).
Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects. 

Timing is of the essence with RU-486.
It is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy, when it is markedly less effective.
That is typically about a three-week window. 

So far, all the studies have concluded that RU-486 is "safe." But "safe," in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, means "there's been no evidence so far of mortality." No one has researched the long-term effects of RU-486 on a woman's health or fertility. 

The drug seems to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken.
Some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again: The studies have reported repeaters in their programs.
But there are no scientific data on this question. 

Rather ominously, rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects, Lancet, the British medical journal, reported in 1987.
However, Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the French physician who invented RU-486, wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys.

While the pound has attempted to stabilize, currency analysts say it is in critical condition	Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week's low of $1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members	Cause
Although the Bank of England's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that Britain's slowing economy is headed for a recession, it is widely believed that Mr. Lawson's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks	If there are any signs that Mr. Major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge, that currency is expected to fall sharply	Contrast

The Senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading	The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of "service fees," which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets. 

Other provisions have a more subtle, but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges.
These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages. 

In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members, these measures could have other, far-reaching repercussions. 

One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct.
Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances. 

It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation.
In an already low-profitmargin business, commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public, depriving the private individual of access to the markets. 

Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them.
This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages. 

Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade, many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers.
This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers.
A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity. 

Finally, under the bill, a number of legitimate, longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned, unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue.
In other words, regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance, rather than through a normal deliberative procedure. 

The affected practices include the placing of oral orders, which is the way most public customer orders are placed, and trading between affiliated brokers, even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client.
Also precluded would be dual trading, whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account, a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets	Restatement

Russell Miller's "Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard" is a biography of the founder of the Church of Scientology.
Mr. Hubbard, who died in 1986, bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church, which licensed them to New Era Publications, a Danish corporation	In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publishing "Bare-Faced Messiah" on the ground that Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard infringed the copyrights	Asynchronous
In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publishing "Bare-Faced Messiah" on the ground that Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard infringed the copyrights	The publisher argued in response that the "fair use" statute permits quotation "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, . . . scholarship, or research	Contrast
District Court Judge Pierre Leval denied the injunction on the ground that New Era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine lawyers call "laches	As for the merits, Judge Leval said that Mr. Miller had written "a serious book of responsible historical criticism	Conjunction
Verbatim quotation was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. Hubbard -- mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. Hubbard's own words	the judge believed	Restatement
The biographer/critic should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example	Judge Leval wrote	Cause
But Judge Leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbidding a biographer of J.D. Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger's personal letters	He distinguished the two cases	Concession
He distinguished the two cases	In Salinger, Judge Leval noted, the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject	Restatement
Still the Salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials	that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard's unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright	Cause
The case went on appeal to the Second Circuit	In a decision in April of this year, Judge Roger Miner, joined by Judge Frank Altimari, agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that "Bare-Faced Messiah" was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright	Asynchronous

As matters stand, the Salinger ruling, torn from context and broadly construed, is controlling	If an author quotes "more than minimal amounts" of unpublished copyrighted materials, as the Salinger decision had it, "he deserves to be enjoined."

The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson's description of himself as a "private asset but a public liability" to Anna Freud and that in any case it was not defamatory	Judge Kozinski found the derivation entirely strained and writes that "for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is . . . a devastating admission of professional dishonesty	Contrast
These were only two of a series of fabrications that had, in Judge Kozinski's words, the cumulative effect of making Mr. Masson "appear more arrogant, less sensitive, shallower, more self-aggrandizing, and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements	As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm's book, Mr. Masson emerges "as a grandiose egotist . . . and, in the end, a self-destructive fool.

Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the "best" schools	As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan, does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated, black, working-class woman, Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her	Conjunction
Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government	The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons	Cause
The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons	Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress	Cause

evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates	The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period, but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated	Contrast
This bias is in no way deliberate	The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data	Alternative
This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor	In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees, it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s	Concession
In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees, it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s	Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector, this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year, on average	Cause
The federal productivity estimators use labor input, rather than output, data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well	Independent estimates of output in those industries, including one by the Department of Labor for banking, suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5% a year between 1948 and 1988	Contrast

The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes	that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product	Restatement
Finally, the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services	In 1985, a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced, and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed	Instantiation
In sum, the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP	For the private domestic business economy, the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point	Contrast

ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment, the rest is easy, right	You just call your broker and say "buy" or "sell	Cause
Dream on	There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doing	Cause
So here's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges	Two things to keep in mind	Conjunction
Two things to keep in mind	Not all exchanges accept every type of order	Conjunction
With a market order, an investor tells a broker to buy or sell "at the market	It's like saying, "get me in now" or "get me out now	Cause
For example, if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060, a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price	that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers	Conjunction
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it	Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock, but not for less than $55	Instantiation
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock, but not for less than $55	A limit order to sell could be entered at that price	Cause
A limit order to sell could be entered at that price	One risk	Contrast
Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level	Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order, and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	Cause
Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order, and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get	Stop orders are sometimes called "stop-loss" orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses	Conjunction
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders, there is a difference	Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above.
In contrast, sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below	Restatement
The crash in October 1987 and last Friday's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and won't do	An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $90 under a stock that was trading at $100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday	Restatement
Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order	Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price	Contrast
Unlike stop orders stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price	If it can't be made at that price, it doesn't get filled	Cause
However, unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price, while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it	As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price	Asynchronous
The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades	It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better	Restatement
he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options	says	Cause
I like to use them to feel out the market	If they don't fill it immediately, then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price	Restatement
This is another timing order	It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment, if they think they can get a better price by waiting	Restatement
This is really two orders in one, generally for the same security or commodity, instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order	In a fast-moving market, it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security	Cause
This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time	On the close" can be added to many types of orders	Instantiation
Stop-close-only orders" are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading	Day orders" expire at the end of the day on which they are entered, "good-till-canceled orders" have no expiration date	Conjunction
On Oct. 19, 1987, some investors learned the consequences of entering "good-til-canceled limit orders" and then forgetting about them	They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel	Cause
It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed	Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are, usually, stuck with the consequences	Cause
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund	For any given move in the overall market, it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall	Restatement
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas	Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market	Contrast
Remember, though, that beta also has important limitations	Beta is only part of the risk in a stock	Instantiation
Beta is only part of the risk in a stock	There is risk that is not associated with market moves, and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that	Cause
In particular, beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock	That "business" risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks	Concession
Our fear was people would look just at the beta {of a gold fund} and say here is an investment with very low risk	In reality it's very volatile, but the movements are not because of market movements	Contrast
This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night, lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs	Risk wears many disguises, and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other, less obvious kinds	Restatement
They estimate the return a person's current portfolio is likely to generate over time, along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year	They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals	List

Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy (Figure 5), with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60% of the car's original value	According to my calculations, these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $22,000 on the open market	Conjunction
I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers	My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold, according to my conservative calculations	Conjunction
With this personal strategy firmly in place, I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage	My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it	Instantiation

The bad news, however, hasn't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning	The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners, and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand, and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business	Contrast

Besides term life and whole life (the old standbys), we now have universal life, universal variable life, flexible adjustable universal life, policies with persistency bonuses, policies festooned with exotic riders, living benefit policies, and on and on	What to do	Cause
First, generalize	Shorn of all their riders, special provisions, and other bells and whistles, insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories: so-called pure insurance, which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death, and permanent insurance, which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive	Restatement
If all you want is death-benefit coverage, pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck, within limits	It's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age	Conjunction

Third and most important, Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount	I'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile	Cause
I'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile	That would be all right with Amex, which could then lock in its investment profit, but it doesn't add up to a "smart money" move for me	Cause
Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else	There is no free lunch, there is only marketing	Restatement
This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance, the kind that amasses cash value	The word "death" cannot be escaped entirely by the industry, but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms, preferring to talk about "savings" and "investment" instead	Cause
but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms, preferring to talk about "savings" and "investment" instead	The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature	Cause
That is gilding the lily	The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle, insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into	Cause
That's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package	Again, no free lunch	Cause
And in most cases, a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is, in effect, paying the salesman's commission as well	investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years, largely because of this	Restatement

Hugely popular, it is far more flexible than straight whole life	I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment	Instantiation

Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise don't use commissioned salesmen	there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial "setup" charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of "surrender fees" for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot	Cause
I compared one universal policy for $130,000 face amount from such an insurer, American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln, Neb., with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen	After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $792, but Id get only $14 from the Equitable	Restatement
The difference is magnified by time, too	At age 65, when I'd stop paying premiums, the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $14,000 higher than the other, even though the Equitable's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate	Restatement

Institutional investors have poured $210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns	These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few "active" stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers, much less beat it	Restatement
But today, indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one	Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average, they have developed "enhanced" indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points	Restatement
Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade, but the index money has been just sort of sitting there	Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money	Contrast

that, at least at the federal level, political "ticket splitting" has been on the rise over the past half century	In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.
Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40%	Restatement
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives	Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40%	Contrast
As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress	In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress	Restatement
In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress	Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly the opposite	Contrast
If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Democratic	If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies	Restatement
but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies	Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making	Cause
In races for the White House, a voter's incentive, at the margin, is to lean Republican	Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	Cause
such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits	The individual voter's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes	Cause
Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives	Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency	Restatement
Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office	Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent	Restatement
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent	To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage, the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates	Cause
Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South	To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office	Restatement
Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House	Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts	Restatement
that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do	First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find	Cause
This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House	The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959	Restatement
Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level	State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse	Restatement
The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services	Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate, which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women	Conjunction
Reversing an eight-year federal policy, the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest, but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother's life is in danger	Mr. Bush's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House, but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill	Conjunction

Under the proposal, a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of "rescissions" to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes	Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50% majority	Asynchronous
